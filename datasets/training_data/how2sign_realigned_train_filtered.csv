3tyfxL2wO-M	3tyfxL2wO-M-8-rgb_front	3tyfxL2wO-M_4	3tyfxL2wO-M_4-8-rgb_front	14.9	20.89	Depending on the coarseness of your hair and the thickness of your hair, you're going to want to intrude something that's a little heavier.
3uRgOnJbEkI	3uRgOnJbEkI-8-rgb_front	3uRgOnJbEkI_15	3uRgOnJbEkI_15-8-rgb_front	67.4	68.49	It is a front approach.
3uRgOnJbEkI	3uRgOnJbEkI-8-rgb_front	3uRgOnJbEkI_6	3uRgOnJbEkI_6-8-rgb_front	27.69	30.61	If you can see, I'm tracing a V on the floor.
3uRgOnJbEkI	3uRgOnJbEkI-8-rgb_front	3uRgOnJbEkI_9	3uRgOnJbEkI_9-8-rgb_front	33.26	36.93	Now, we're just going to take it wider, so we have V step.
3uWEhIUwMrY	3uWEhIUwMrY-8-rgb_front	3uWEhIUwMrY_13	3uWEhIUwMrY_13-8-rgb_front	58.02	61.38	The water is actually to clean off the beer pong balls, okay?
3uWEhIUwMrY	3uWEhIUwMrY-8-rgb_front	3uWEhIUwMrY_23	3uWEhIUwMrY_23-8-rgb_front	119.8	123.06	Those are the supplies that you need, so let's move on to the next step.
3uWEhIUwMrY	3uWEhIUwMrY-8-rgb_front	3uWEhIUwMrY_3	3uWEhIUwMrY_3-8-rgb_front	11.44	15.12	Right, let me tell you the supplies needed in beer pong.

3wAKK4jQrXw	3wAKK4jQrXw-5-rgb_front	3wAKK4jQrXw_5	3wAKK4jQrXw_5-5-rgb_front	39.57	47.67	So, our tab told us 17th fret on the B string, so I'm going to use my third finger.
3wAKK4jQrXw	3wAKK4jQrXw-5-rgb_front	3wAKK4jQrXw_7	3wAKK4jQrXw_7-5-rgb_front	59.3	61.02	So, it's going to look like that.
3wAKK4jQrXw	3wAKK4jQrXw-5-rgb_front	3wAKK4jQrXw_8	3wAKK4jQrXw_8-5-rgb_front	61.02	70.14	I'm going to pick and I'm going to pull off in kind of a down and up at the same time motion with my third finger, kinda down and up.
3wrA8v-xDlg	3wrA8v-xDlg-8-rgb_front	3wrA8v-xDlg_3	3wrA8v-xDlg_3-8-rgb_front	63.96	67.06	Otherwise why would you only stop at one side, what's the point of that?
3wrA8v-xDlg	3wrA8v-xDlg-5-rgb_front	3wrA8v-xDlg_5	3wrA8v-xDlg_5-5-rgb_front	81.51	90.98	A vest is pretty much literally means that it is going to be the same on both sides so that is why I drew it like this, it is easier to follow.

3xag4Y3JqHo	3xag4Y3JqHo-8-rgb_front	3xag4Y3JqHo_2	3xag4Y3JqHo_2-8-rgb_front	14.27	52.22	They're all situated on the inner part of the tooth and so what we have to do for the most part, when you get a cavity, the cavity is on the top surface or from the side, it breaks through the enamel and into part of the tooth structure and then basically exposing these inner part nerve tissue and the blood supply.
3xag4Y3JqHo	3xag4Y3JqHo-5-rgb_front	3xag4Y3JqHo_4	3xag4Y3JqHo_4-5-rgb_front	69.99	80.37	Once that's all done, this area is sealed with a rubber-based material, and in doing so, the bacteria from outside cannot go in and from the top, cannot go back out.

3yjFlBByBX4	3yjFlBByBX4-1-rgb_front	3yjFlBByBX4_10	3yjFlBByBX4_10-1-rgb_front	91.95	95.83	And then I'll wait thirty seconds.

3yjFlBByBX4	3yjFlBByBX4-1-rgb_front	3yjFlBByBX4_2	3yjFlBByBX4_2-1-rgb_front	15.98	19.25	You don't want extra chemicals in your tea.

3zd-g_u97RM	3zd-g_u97RM-8-rgb_front	3zd-g_u97RM_3	3zd-g_u97RM_3-8-rgb_front	52.53	72.94	Once you got the fruit in there you would gather this up like this, with the fruit in it, and you would start twisting this, and the fruit would start juicing out juicing out all the great juices through the colander and into the pot down here.
4-Jt6C_aKpc	4-Jt6C_aKpc-5-rgb_front	4-Jt6C_aKpc_15	4-Jt6C_aKpc_15-5-rgb_front	84.53	87.46	And we're going to chop now our green scallion.

40dTE31p5uA	40dTE31p5uA-5-rgb_front	40dTE31p5uA_12	40dTE31p5uA_12-5-rgb_front	105.65	117.91	If you see here along the edge, there's just a little bit of light from this wall that's being bounced back at the urn.
40dTE31p5uA	40dTE31p5uA-5-rgb_front	40dTE31p5uA_4	40dTE31p5uA_4-5-rgb_front	15.18	22.52	For example, this alcove, we see the key elements of light and shadow.

41uzlhDMROA	41uzlhDMROA-3-rgb_front	41uzlhDMROA_4	41uzlhDMROA_4-3-rgb_front	31.16	42.17	You find the telephone pole, raise it up to the wire, and move across the wire, and there's the bird, hopefully he hasn't flown.
41uzlhDMROA	41uzlhDMROA-3-rgb_front	41uzlhDMROA_6	41uzlhDMROA_6-3-rgb_front	45.27	48.22	Where I've got my body perpendicular to a line where the bird is, I look at the bird.

42c5l12RhWo	42c5l12RhWo-8-rgb_front	42c5l12RhWo_10	42c5l12RhWo_10-8-rgb_front	73.34	81.48	But I'll tell you, for five dollars a quart, it?s much better to save an old toilet and de-lime the rim than it is to throw the toilet away.
42c5l12RhWo	42c5l12RhWo-5-rgb_front	42c5l12RhWo_4	42c5l12RhWo_4-5-rgb_front	27.75	39.64	It?s an acid solution and what we do we take and we pour this whole quart in to the overflow tube all at once.
42c5l12RhWo	42c5l12RhWo-5-rgb_front	42c5l12RhWo_6	42c5l12RhWo_6-5-rgb_front	47.13	52.95	You will then notice that the acid is coming out of the rim of the toilet.

45XYg7z7CdQ	45XYg7z7CdQ-5-rgb_front	45XYg7z7CdQ_13	45XYg7z7CdQ_13-5-rgb_front	105.83	112.38	Think about can I just throw it in my washer or can I hose it off, will it clean up easily for the next season.

46ambgo7EyY	46ambgo7EyY-3-rgb_front	46ambgo7EyY_1	46ambgo7EyY_1-3-rgb_front	7.9	28.57	The spine is capable of elongating, it's capable of moving laterally on each side, it's capable of twisting to each side, it's capable of a back bend, and a forward bend, so actually those are really seven movements of the spine.
46wX8xjt7mA	46wX8xjt7mA-5-rgb_front	46wX8xjt7mA_11	46wX8xjt7mA_11-5-rgb_front	60.92	63.54	It's going to be a little dry because it's curly.

476vh2-HlV0	476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front	476vh2-HlV0_16	476vh2-HlV0_16-8-rgb_front	111.94	118.4	We're just going to rinse it off and then put it to the side to dry.
476vh2-HlV0	476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front	476vh2-HlV0_6	476vh2-HlV0_6-8-rgb_front	26.72	38.36	Then just use your mild dish soap that you would use for cleaning your dishes and silverware.
476vh2-HlV0	476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front	476vh2-HlV0_9	476vh2-HlV0_9-8-rgb_front	48.98	50.96	First of all, this helps prevent it from getting dirty.

477ZE29Y6eU	477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front	477ZE29Y6eU_18	477ZE29Y6eU_18-8-rgb_front	147.03	155.68	So this net cover is going to keep him pretty much covered from the elements from his neck and it won't allow any of the moisture to get down inside his blanket and run down into or on his chest or inside the blanket.
477ZE29Y6eU	477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front	477ZE29Y6eU_3_4	477ZE29Y6eU_3_4-8-rgb_front	22.88	39.23	This one doesn't necessarily go with this blanket but will just show you how it works. It slides up over the top of their head and then comes down thru their ears and they can see through it there we go so it would fit down over their face.
477ZE29Y6eU	477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front	477ZE29Y6eU_5	477ZE29Y6eU_5-8-rgb_front	39.4	42.75	Now you'd say why do I need a hood for my horse.

47DGHJiOzPQ	47DGHJiOzPQ-5-rgb_front	47DGHJiOzPQ_6	47DGHJiOzPQ_6-5-rgb_front	20.73	23.03	That means you didn't iron it long enough.
47DGHJiOzPQ	47DGHJiOzPQ-5-rgb_front	47DGHJiOzPQ_9	47DGHJiOzPQ_9-5-rgb_front	38.89	41.82	So if you try to iron it and it's not sticking.

47HHNulBaX0	47HHNulBaX0-5-rgb_front	47HHNulBaX0_3	47HHNulBaX0_3-5-rgb_front	14.91	19.2	Here's the major scale, all seven notes.

47yGbJ5YDYk	47yGbJ5YDYk-5-rgb_front	47yGbJ5YDYk_5	47yGbJ5YDYk_5-5-rgb_front	86.77	96.97	Holding the triangle the triangle itself which is gonna produce the tone and the hammer that helps you with that.
484PoKla0ug	484PoKla0ug-1-rgb_front	484PoKla0ug_2	484PoKla0ug_2-1-rgb_front	10.43	13.93	Obviously, the main thing to the 6-2 defense is we want to stop the run.
48DncKS_yN0	48DncKS_yN0-8-rgb_front	48DncKS_yN0_14	48DncKS_yN0_14-8-rgb_front	70.58	73.05	Into the pass, thumbs down, ok?
