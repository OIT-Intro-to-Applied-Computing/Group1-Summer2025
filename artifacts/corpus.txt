The county jail basically houses people in the forms of pods where they have several different rooms inside of the pods and you're living in a space that's extremely small without any storage.
That lock box is usually about 2 1/2 x 1 1/2 feet and it's about a foot deep.
Under those circumstances you begin to realize that there are certain things you have to do in order to be comfortable and healthy as well.
"He turns his upper body right away, he runs over."
It does not even look good.
"So now we will show you what you want to do, as opposed to that."
"Alright, we've introduce forward rolling."
Okay.
The function of a ball.
"So, the match sticks, actually, fit nicely across the top of the windmill, they don't have to fit exactly the same measurement as the top of the carton, but if you lay them across, if you double them up, even though they hang over a little bit, they still fit nicely onto the side of the milk carton, and we only have to do one side, the side, obviously, in the front, that's going to be seen, and we go all the way down to the bottom of where it angles, and starts going vertical again."
"So, you can move each finger independently of the others in a stretching fashion."
But that's something - wearing a night guard is something you definitely want to wear on a consistent basis every night.
You can use this with punches but usually you use this with just slaps.
"So we're going to start off like we always do with making sure we have our distance, eye contact to let each other know that we're going to start the movement, then I'm going to wind up like this."
We're going to do the same on the opposite side of the deck by the spindles and handrails.
"And what we can do, we'll brush that in. But we'll do that as we go. And as we work our way across the deck, we'll brush that in there and blend that stain out so we've got an even color when we come in with our mop head."
"And so, this is the chart that makes our course."
"We've gone over the hook, the act one hook."

"You do have to get this from a wood turning, or wood working specialty store."
"The shortstop is one of those positions, where they are probably one of the strongest arms on the field."
"Just remember, as a shortstop, that you've always got to be thinking."
"You could be charging a slap, a bunt, but you've always got to be communicating."
"Communicating with your second basemen, on who's covering."
"Communicating with your third basemen, in case there's a steal."
"So here, again, we're going to have a hilltop."
And then everything else fades off into the distance.
"The lower zone that represents the lower strokes, alright?"
Or you might find that their upper or lower zone is very pronounced.
"So if you were to write a word such as happy, that can show you all three of your zones. H-A-P-P-Y."
Usually a pencil will have a conical tip on it but what we want to do with our pencil is take a little piece of sandpaper and put the pencil flat on the sandpaper and rub it back and forth like that so we make a chisel point.
"Where in these beds if they don't come from the top or from artificial means, it ain't going to happen."
And you're just compressing the clay and smoothing the surface.

It will actually remember your uncles in step and the shape of his foot and how we walks.
And you can see here he created a dark versus a light and that has to do with how close the lines are together and how thick they are.
"He uses very thin lines where it's very light, he uses very thick lines where it's dark."
"So using the blocks, that's going to help her be able to balance more easily and elevate the floor a little bit higher so it can take out any problems she might have with tight hamstrings or a tight low spine."
Yes.
"So she needs to focus and breathe, maybe even come through a little arch in the spine as she presses her hand right down into the earth and lengthens up with her foot."
"Today I'll be showing you how to remove your old doorknob, and replace it with a new one."
"A Phillips screwdriver, for removing the bolts on the doorknob and you don't have to have it, but an electric drill would help, because it can remove the bolts much faster than you would be able to with this."
I use a coarse one because the toenails are a lot thicker then your finger nails so you are going to want to use a coarse one on your toenails.
The biggest part about renting something that is really detrimental to it is that you have to put down a deposit.
"So, in some ways, that's actually going to...going to work for you."
"When you have to rent a camera for a job -- let's say, you are a professional photographer or someone just starting out in the photography market -- you want to make sure that you call the camera store to make sure they have your piece of equipment."

"You're bad. I love you. Can I do a duet with you?"" Why? It's not because he can dance, it is because he has so much confidence that he doesn't care and it makes it look like he's absolutely amazing as a dancer on stage."
"One of the biggest things--one of the biggest ways you can gain stage presence, I'm going to tell you right now, okay, there's nothing else you need to know."
So many people copy that.
Make sure they both measure up and I also like to fold them together.
We are going to do a four-step buttonhole.
Put it on the first step of the botton hole.
Fold it over about 3/4 of inch and turn to the right side of the bag.
"Hi my name is Dean Hale and today I'm going to give you a general overview of how to play the American classic, poker."

A lot of people just don't understand the whole concept of riding backwards and there is a couple of things you should keep in mind when you are doing that.

It's really important to ride your jump up when you're doing a tuck.
Now advanced tumbling is most easily done in combination from a round-off because you're going to get a lot of momentum.
In the air your layout position is basically going to be this.
"After you've mastered your layout, you can start doing fulls which are the most fun tumbling."
A full is going to be a layout in this position with a full rotation in the air.
"So, my window is thirty one inches high."
When you are working with someone and you want to give them a massage what you want to do is oil their back up first and I have already done that.
"You don't want to put so much oil on someone when you are giving a massage that they're like sliding around in oil and grease so just enough to give you some nice glide is all you need and then just do some nice soothing strokes, choppy short strokes are not always the most comfortable or feel the best."
"And, taking my scoring tool which has multiple needles."
It is very pretty.
I am going to secure this pre-strung beads here and measure it off.
You can see it enter each of the beads.
You can mark the halfway point between each of the scallops that you have with some pins.
"Do not be tempted to continue to bead till you are too close to the needle, because you need room to make your knot."
"Make sure you straighten your knees, huge pop O.k?"
So we have here on eight.
Good!
Let's try backing up now and we can add it all together.
We're going to pop it right here and two.
Releasing the lower back and popping it back in.
Alright?
You might want to test it just to make sure that it is not loose.
In this video clip I will be showing you the final step in installing a smoke detector.
"Anne, what can we expect when we come to reflexologist?"
"the Mobil 1 synthetic, they can say you can void the warranty on the motorcycle if you use an additive with a synthetic."
There are numerous articles on it and a lot of information out there.
"A lot of Technicians in the industry, I've been in the industry for ten years, we all believe, never met one that would disagree with me, that oil additives are not necessary, especially for air cooled V Twin motorcycles."
I'm just going to warm it up a little bit before I put it on.
"So someone who has acne skin, steam is good for it as well because that's obviously problems with maybe pores that are clogged or just hormones and things like that so it'll help the product to take deeper into the skin."
Sometimes if it's dried out too much it's going to produce more oils naturally and as a result tend to be even oilier than if you hadn't used a moisturizer.
Welcome to Sedona Spa.
We're first going to start with a cleansing treatment.
"Alright, take a nice, deep breath."
This is only about twelve hundred psi.
"Then, you just kind of want to test it and pull the trigger."
That's going to be about what I normally work with.
It still has pretty good pressure.
Now we're going to talk a little bit about pressure washing.
Because mostly we're just washing.
It's holding on pretty good.
I'll work my way down the eaves that way.
So I kind of keep a ladder handy.
"Now, all that's left is this bottom part on the wall."
"In the next area, what we're going to talk about is the mouthpieces."
"And, then pour that into the sink."
"The old rubber mouthpieces that you just insert and use temporarily, like maybe in a gym in a sparring match or if the boxer forgets his mouthpiece."
"And today we're going to talk about, how to find a massage therapist."
"Creative drama is not about teaching to the test, it's better."
You might even find in iron stone a pattern that's the same as flow blue and you can find the same pattern in mulberry so there's a lot of different examples of iron stone bases that are used.
They are very collectible and it all is very subjective it's what you find appealing so these are just a few example for you to look at before you start collecting.
Right now we're out in a garage.
"never use your spray paints inside the house, it'll smell for days."
Many different colors of household type paints you can buy.
Then using warm water and dish detergent you want to wash your car.
I like to use a cardboard box for paint booth.
"So, do you just have reeking breath that you're trying to get rid of?"
"Of course, you're going to want to brush and floss your teeth three times a day, and also, you can purchase like an over-the-counter mouth rinse with rinsing with this at least twice a day will help with kind of maintaining that nice fresh breath."
"O.k. Now we're going to start off with the bath tub. And then, we'll move on to the shower. So let me get my gloves on, first."
"Now these items, you want to make sure."
Here is a really easy way.
Then I just run it under the water.
This is easy as that.
I'm going to take our ring and place it on this.
Now take your time.
We have this picture of a little kitty.
We've made a ready made out of this same molding because I did a large picture in this for my customer and I had a little bit left over.
"It comes in these little packets, these little foam blocks."
They last a long time; you can actually wash them out and reuse them.
What we're looking at here is my preferred method for filtering a turtle tank.
"And, as an alternative to just having moss at the bottom of the plant or nothing at all, you have some nice full decorative foliage, in their own saucers because they have different water needs than the Ficus."
It will come out wavy like this.
I'm Ivan Madar.
Alright in this clip we are going to be going over how to go over the bags that we are stacking up.
"If you touch it, you don't want to touch it because if you do they are going to fall over."
The plants when they come up and begin to draw will be long and skinny.
"When you get ready to transplant them in the garden, it is best if you have a robust or short squat plant than a tall skinny one."
"There's some good stuff in here, also very short."
It's divided up by category.
"It's small enough to fit in your backpack, your pocket, and keep it with you in rehearsals, so if you want to learn a lot of improv games, this is the book for you."
"It's very succinct, very clear."
"I really recommend this to beginners, or new improvisers."
Hi!
The first step we have to trim off the green beans we have to cut off the tail and the head.
So now we are going to peel our shrimp.
What I'm going to do this is the head is already off.
All different types of trainers do different types of exercises.
"If you're considering getting a personal trainer, you want to make sure that you're aware of what you want your goals to be so that you can get a personal trainer that's right for you."
It means the whole body.
"So before we're going to attach the front to the rest of the pieces, what we're going to do is take some elastic and we're actually going to make a little holder to hold bottles of wine."
"You want to go back and forth a few times just to make sure that's pretty secured. Go ahead and do the center seam the same way again I like to make these fairly large because if you do want to say use one of those two litter bottles of water or I think a liter in a half, those are fairly large cause you do want to give space for them to fairly fit."
"Also if you're going on a picnic if you don't drink of course, you can just add some bottle of water or ice tea or something like that."
I'm Michael Seto.
Explain to these people?
I was reviewing the other day how my mortgage was advertising... JOE PARSONS: Uh-huh.
JOE PARSONS: Four.
"JOE PARSONS: Kleenex, lipstick, and a brassiere."
"JOE PARSONS: Barbara Bush, a Buick, a giant tub of Red Vines licorice."
"LES MCGEHEE: That is absolutely correct, Joseph, and you don't win anything."
I have a pair of these hanging on the wall in my house and they're lots of fun to own.
"This is a church near me, in North Andover Massachusetts, I'm talking to you from Andover Mass."
"All right, so you want to leave more than enough clay to work with."
"All right, now all we have to do is let all that set up, and while that's setting up we can go ahead, and make a make a handle; let that set up too, and we'll, then by the time everything is all ready to go what we're going to do is take this lid, want to flip it upside down, clean the top, and depending on how the handle looks, either put another handle on here, or put a little knob or something the to where you can just lift it off the teapot."
Lightening is when your baby actually drops deeper into your pelvis.
It's easier to digest your food because there's more room with your intestines there.
"Now that you've got a baby in here, everything is pushed up or everything is pushed down."
"So when your baby drops, the bladder, which is right here, the baby's going to drop into your pelvis deeper in there and put that pressure on the bladder."
I'm kind of grabbing my ski pants.
"You're going to want to get into your athletic stance, your feet are shoulders width apart and you're just going to bend down at the waist, following the legs down until you feel the stretch, reaching for those toes."
There you go.
Then do the same thing with the other leg.
I like to go simple.
A lot of times your stem and your cup will be just slightly off center from each and that's not a big deal.
You're going to use a ribbon tool to do the trimming.
You want that cup to have a nice smooth curve.
Lower down for just a moment.
Good.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to slice this just like you would chicken strips for fajita.
Stick some fresh ground black pepper.
You're definitely going to need some salt.
"As far as salt and pepper goes, you just want to eyeball it and season to taste."
"As far as the vegetarian enchiladas, I'm also going to have spinach, but these already nicely washed and ready to go and I'm also going to adds some cheese to all the enchiladas."
You can use green or you can use red.
Zero.
Congratulations on a great score on this hand.
"We've got just several cards left on our board, and we've, we know we're going to get a pretty decent score."

"See if you can make it to ten breaths in down dog, and when you're done gently drop the knees and rest for a moment in Childs pose."
"Down dog is one of the most widely recognized yoga poses, and it's an all over rejuvenating stretch."
"Are you tired of using the eyelash curler everyday, and wondering if you can permanently curl your eyelashes?"
"Have them explain the procedure to you, which is when they're going to perm your eyelashes, they're going to clean the eye area, protect the eye area, and have you keep your eyes closed, for the full process, and procedure."
Can you permanently curl your eyelashes?
"Hello, I'm Tim Gipson and today I want to talk to you about carpenter safety."
"Next thing I'm going to talk to you about is a table saw when we talk about safety in carpenter tools, a table saw is a good place to start."
"And then you have other things such as push blocks, and a push stick."
"You can let it go a little bit beyond, it doesn't matter, and then I like to take a piece and make sure it is totally anchored by going all the way around your container and this tends to stick it a lot better when it is stuck to itself so make sure you overlap it."
We're going to attach it right to the purse.
I'm just going to bend that across so it's nice and neat.
I'm going to bring my cat over here.
Place your wire towards the edge of the fabric.
Just grab around his head and you want to hold the beak closed so that he can't open up and snap at you.
You want to smooth it out and round it out so that it's more of the natural formation of the beak.
They have this specific blotchy pattern of lights and shadows because they have evolved to live on the forest floor in Madagascar and with this pattern they're able to blend in well with the leaf litter.
"So, your shots should look like this, with crema on the top."
And so if they just want a double espresso it would just be two shots and then cream or sugar or flavor in it.
They're working as fast as they can.
5 minutes?
"So, our combination is going to go lat and row."
If this is too easy for you go up to a red band.
"So, your goal is to really pull those shoulders back, so we're working deep into your lats."
We're even trying to get up into your trap area.
You're going to take your elbows out and all we're going to do is lean back just a little bit so that we're in our motion so that from your shoulders to your hip are actually at a slant and you're not straight up and down with your body.
"And what I'm talking about is, you know, we've taken a look at, at what you're good at, we've taken a look at what it is that you want to do, we know what's available out there."
"Whatever it is, because the job market is so competitive, you really need to be the best."
"So guys, now we're going to do some straight crunches."
It's all environmentally friendly so let's get started.
First we're going to have a pair of gloves.
"If sitting on the sand cannot be avoided, or a barrier of space cannot be placed between you and the sand, then wear some type of longer shorts, or swimming type of bathing suit, to avoid bites to the back of the legs, from the sand flea."
"And we will probably take the aluminum foil off on the front on the top of the breast, about a half hour before we start to glaze."
It's turkey sunscreen.
Ok have a nice trip.
"Until the thermometer inserted in the inner thigh, registers165 degrees."
We are going to be basting the turkey with the stock in the bottom of the pan.
"For On Gardening, I'm Stan DeFreitas, ""Mr. Green Thumb""."
"There's no nematodes, there's no disease, because this material is sterile."
"As a matter of fact, they just fall off when you touch them and these are the ones that you would plant."
"If you do, just kind of clean it up just a little."
Now that's how you do the heart monitor nail design.
"The choice is up to you, on either one that you do, but you want to do this to all ten."
Not everyone has a strong pulse; some people have a real light one.
"Once you have it done, again you'll have five or six lines total, you'll want to make sure that the polish wasn't stringy in the striping brush, if you get any on the side of the finger, you can just dip your French manicure brush back in your polish remover and just clean up the sides."
You want to always take it to that place where it is comfortable to come back up.
We need to have it not just for when we're performing the play but for rehearsals and building the set and all sorts of things.
There's time to do that and we're about where we should be right now.
They put on 3 productions a year I believe.
"Let's say if you are doing let's say that you took a short trip of ten days like from New York from California so you want on the itinerary should be all of the gigs, what time, they start, what time the sound track is, the contact person, lights, load in time, the hotel your staying at, its phone number and this type of information."
Feel the ribcage is working its way to the thighs and then back down.
"Then once you're done with that if you like to bring your feet down on the ground like we did last week, you do the last set of crunches without the ball."
It'll make it a lot easier especially when you're tired at the end of it.
You want to make sure to get past that surf as soon as possible.
"You know, if you start most of your house plants you need to have a good Watering Can, and normally you get something like this it's a little bit smaller than some of the watering cans that you've used outside on your vegetable garden area."
Make sure you use it exactly according to those directions with your indoor watering can.
"For On Gardening, I'm Stan De Freitas, Mr. Green Thumb."
"I; one of the things I really have trouble with is that they start so early, I like the staring times better of the Elementary schools."
I'm going to cover her neck with a towel.
"Hi, I'm Priscilla Flynn, speaking to you today from Yoga Sanctuary in Windham, New Hampshire and you can read more about us on our website, yogasanctuary.com."
It will look something like this (video demo).
There are a couple of things we can do.
If we know that they have a bad snapper or a slow kicker we might try to get there and block the kick.
If we have that on we're not so worried about our return as we are getting in there to block the kick.
"Very easy, not too much."
"Here's a little, nice little bite size focaccia wedges."
"So forward, forward, nice and fluid and back."
"Saw them across center, saw them across front then across the front, other side, then back to center, then back and across."
"So Jonesy, whenever you're ready."
So the first phase is bilateral using two legs at the same time.
Return back across.
"So, you're heading around and you can't see which way you're going."
And you also need to know how to roll backwards just a little bit to be able to do this trick well.
"The most important thing before you paint on anything especially metal is to wipe it down with some sort of degreaser, precleaner that is what I'm going to do right here."
"You rub that down pretty good, then you take your dry rag, rub over that, that would pick up the solvent and any degrease and residue that is left on it."
These are the dark wash. Now these are like the newest fad because everybody right now is wearing the dark jeans and these are called skinny jeans which I will model for you later.
It's a typical jean color.
"The last pathway, type four, still immune-mediated, but it doesn't use antibodies."
So it's not very reliable in determining your sensitivity to a particular food.
"It's actually seeing what's happened, what's...you know, is there inflammation that's being caused?"
"Type one is what's referred to as IgE, or Immunoglobulin E antibody-mediated response, and in that one, it's actually a true food allergy."
"And just like and French braid, you're going to grab a piece of hair, only this time it's a much smaller amount because we're working with less hair, and you're going to divide it up in three's."
"As you can see, the stance for a man is a different position."
"They let their hands just rest on their thighs and by still attaining perfect posture, keeping the shoulders down, slightly back but relaxed and the stomach muscles in, again, when you're sitting keep your stomach muscles in so that your chest expands and you feel relaxed and comfortable."
The first part to the loop is the initiation of it.
Back in the oven for a few seconds.
"And you'll want to work, not right on the edge because the spoon gets too heavy so, but, where you can roll it."
"So, grab a cookie and you can usually grab it without the spatula, if it sticks a little bit just go ahead and get your little metal spatula a loosen it again."
"Basically what you are going to do is make sure you've got some styling product on your hair, your hair is not necessarily have to be completely wet, it can just be slightly damp like the model."
"And, as I mentioned in the very beginning, uncial hand has a particular proportion."
Hold it down like so.
"So, do it on all four sides, turn it up, all four sides."
"Play around with the origami, have fun and enjoy."
"So what we're going to do is we're really going to start off with the traditional water bomb base, and if you really don't know how to do that, there's other videos that I have out that you can go and look and it's going to look basically look like this."
And you're going to do that to all four sides.
"Just open this up, and this, squash fold it, open it back."
"So, again we're concentrating most of the color to the apple of the cheek and just lightly going up the cheek bone."
"Alright, let's do it."
"We could, for maintenance for a comb twist is going to be a lot more because a comb twist is basically using gel and creating coils with your hair."
"Hi, in this segment we're going to talk about a bash."
"Here, bash."
"Now, a bash is different than a brush because you're actually hitting it a lot harder, and a bash is really intended to put to a lot more spin on the Frisbee."
"So, if the Frisbee is going counterclockwise position, and it's here, you strike it right on the side. So you're basically coming on, you're going to cup your hand a little bit."
You can hold wherever you feel comfortable and wherever your partner feels comfortable.
"Girls, it's really your job to sit back into the guy's hand."
"For the stance, you and your partner are going to be about a foot away with the male in the back."
"Girls, you need to keep your eyes forward, and basically you can't see where your feet are going to land."
"Though guys, you really have to catch her feet."
You want to make sure that you have your seatbelt on before you begin to drive.
"Make sure that you have your safety clip attached somewhere very securely, either to a piece of clothing, to your person and then begin working and doing your work on the treadmill."
We don't want to step on to a treadmill that somebody has left running and hasn't had the safety clip on or it's still on.
"You can bring the knees into the chest, wrapping your hands around your legs."
"Both legs are going to come up, toward the ceiling, and we're going to take a deep breath."
"Just taking deep breaths as you hold this pose, trying to keep your feet close to your hand or wrist."
"Inhaling, exhaling and trying to press that left hip, close to the floor and then you're going to use your breath and your obliques, exhale slowly, bring both legs back to center."
We touched on supplements and we talked about the benefits of getting a proper diet for your energy metabolism.
It's best that you consult a dietitian or you can contact me on my website www.lifestillnutrition .com or please consult your physician.
"If you can't afford the cage now, don't get the snake."
Okay now I am going to show you the materials that you need to assemble to make this project.
These happen to Austrian crystals.
You need four jump rings.
"You will need special glue called Strass 244, which is for glueing on the crystals."
You need a sixteenth centimeters of antique cooper chain.
"Lager and Lime, what do you know?"
Bottoms up.
"So by doing that I'm really going to feel that stretch in the lower lat all the way up to the upper part of my lats, or the wings on the side of my body."
So the stretch will look like this.

"To change the amount or the time that your espresso shots are going to take, you're going to do a thicker or a finer grind."
A thicker grind is going to let the water sipped in a little bit more and take a longer time to pull the shots.

"There's probably the most important thing that you're going to be able to do, if you're in standing position, you're going to be in the neutral standing position with the feet about as wide as your hips, tail bone tucked under, and nice and strong."
"After we have hit the roots on our 4 sections, we are going to let that sit for another 20 minutes."

"Somewhere in Egypt is a big river called Denial, and often times we are in denial because we don't really want to admit what we're doing."
"Look, I'm seeing you, and I'm dating you, and I'm not seeing someone else."
But you're not dating.
"By definition, the definition is, if you're dating, you're dating some One, you're not seeing many people."
"This is Dr. Paul, author of ""Boomer Girls, a Boomer woman's guide to men and dating"", and host of Ask Dr. Paul."
"This is just one of the common mistakes that happens when you're trying something new, or you're rolling a little too fast."

You can use as much as you want; it does take a little bit of elbow grease getting in there.
"Now that we've gotten all of our easy dirt and grease up, it's time to go in for the stubborn stains using some baking soda."
If the pages are allowed to dry while they are touching they will fuse together into one mass.
Now one of the problems that you are going to have once you put all of the paper in between the pages is that it is going to distort the book.
"Of course if you want to use your book ever again, your best option is to have slightly distorted pages in order for you to be able to read them."
DR. SUSAN JEWELL: Hello.
"So, these are some ways that you can actually help to reduce, and prevent, and reduce the symptoms of fever."
"Now in this clip, we're going to talk about alternative way versus the conventional way of treating fevers but brief--and that's the herbal, herbal remedies."
Do you use a baseball knee slide?
A lot of guys will throw it over like so.
What I actually like to do is start at the bottom and kind of fold it in half.
I am going to leave enough room because we are going to wrap the other end around this.
"You know make their seat foams really thin because they're not, you know they're not needing to do the moto."
Guys just hitting dirt jumps.
"So, you're at the restaurant and you want to impress your lady."
This is great when you're out and you bought your lady that happy meal and you really want to impress her with a little flower afterwards.
"And, she's going to be very happy and willing tonight."
I totally feel this mask tingling.
This is when I actually do use a wash cloth to take off.
If a honey bee stings you.
You definitely want to use gloves when it comes to using these materials.
"What we have is, this is lamination resin."
This is a four ounce fiber glass.
"And, what you do is, you know, you use the resin to apply the fiberglass and get it to bond to the surf board."
"And then, this is what is called Q Cell, or micro balloons."
"And, what it is it is just a finely chopped fiber glass."
"And it, what I call it is a surf board bondo, you know what I mean."
You want to feel very comfortable in what you're wearing.
Comfortable shoes is a must.
"Something that you can tie, and that wouldn't slip off very easily."
"Lures always come with a hook, but sometimes it's not the hook you want."
"In other states there aren't regulations like that, but you might still want to change them for other reasons."
So I've got a single hook on this lure right now.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to change it to a treble hook.
"I'm just going to put my nail, my thumbnail into that ring, bend it apart and now I'm going to start the hook that I want to take off backwards."
"You had 4 lollipops and they can draw the lollipops if they need to but this time they might not need to, plus 3 equals how many?"
Then tell them another number story.
"I had 8 teddy bears and somebody gave me 2 more, how many teddy bears did I have at the end of the day?"
And they write it in.
"Drawing teddy bears would be tedious, tell them to make a circle for each teddy bear or a dot."
"In this clip, we'll actually be ear candling."
This is where your bowl of water comes in handy.
"You simply remove the candle from your ear, being careful, and remove it from the tray, and then drop the end in the water."
Not because they're the least important but because they're very important.
"They own the 18 that we talked about, anywhere inside that 18 on the defensive end of the field, the goal keeper is allowed to get that ball."
"You have to make sure that you control the ball, it's a person that has to dive and make saves and has to probably get a little dirtier than everybody else as well."
"Making sure that you're making sure that that ball never gets into the back of that net, that is your job."
"Your job is awesome because you can see the field, you kind of need to be the field general, telling your defense where to be, seeing the different players and where they need to put the ball, making sure you move your players into right position."
Be sure the juice coming out from the beef we want to get them inside the wok because we want to keep the vegetables dry and not from the oil and the grease is off the beef.

First of all.
Spray it with your favorite dusting oil.
"Essentially, all you're doing is putting bait down a hole to attract fish."
"So you can do anything from chopping up shiners, and putting pieces down a hole; that's really a good technique for lake trout, to taking maggots putting them down a hole."
"You can also do the same thing; you can cut up night crawlers into very small pieces; again, put those down the hole."
"Now, I am going to show you how a terracotta sculpture is made, a small piece, but I will show you."
"This is before fire, when in the fire is sand, rust, and brick, so if we keep it in the solo shape the heat is distributed much better, so that the heat doesn't affect."
Thank you.
"You take a knife and cut the edges, cut the edges, so that you get a nice long six inch scale or eight inch scale depending on what."
There's no question it takes four legs to make a usable horse.
"Then, we have down here, another part similar."
There is a barrage of places that you can take real estate classes.
These are all things you can see just from following the ball.
"This is why in our stance we have a level head, we have both eyes pointed down at the pitcher, makes it much easier to pick up."
A) if you don't see the ball you can't hit the ball.
What is the other thing that you get to see?
Basically they are a mixture of essential oils that have alcohol or some other kinds of preservatives added to them.
"One of his other faults, he does fidget a little (laughing)."
His faults we're going to overcome because one thing that Bailey has that goes with what I look for in a barrel horse is an excellent disposition.
"However, as we'll talk about there are some conformational faults that I will overlook if the horse is a performer."
"So you're going to tense, release, tense, and release."
Another exercise you can do is to help strengthen the inner thighs.
"Alright, we're going to continue to cut up onions until they're nice and small and then we're going to go ahead and make our sauce for the steak."
That's going to make the sauce a little bit ahead of time so we give it a chance to cool down before we spoon it over the top of our steak and mushrooms.
"Alright, those onions look pretty good so we're just going to move them off to the side."
We're going to take a small mixing bowl and we're going to go ahead and put a tablespoon of Dijon mustard.
"You can do this with country mustard, horseradish mustard, depending on how much you like spice."
Now we're ready to cut.
So what I've done is for one of my dimensions created a line so it's nice to know where you're going.
Once I'm lined up I hold it in my place.
So if it soaks overnight it's going to be very moist you want it to be saturated fully.
And what I'm going to do is cut a piece to fit in this container.
This segment would be a background in Buddhism.
Hi!
"Now if you feel any strain, any pressure in the knee, you must be very, very careful and get that checked out, because any kind of damage down there can get bad in a hurry."
"Again, one way and the other way."
"Whenever you're measuring something like this it can have a tendency to spill, so it's best to pour it out over into what you plan to put it in, that way there's no waste."
If you like costume jewelry and you want to just buy a big bunch of it all at once it's very easy to do this within a limited budget at either an antiques fair or a knock off place or a discount store like Target or Mervyns.

Open up a bottle of nice white wine.
"We're going to eat it, we're going to open up some wine, and we're going to tell you storage, how much it costs."
"They will brown it, it'll look beautiful in the oven."
Make some asparagus like I said.
Know your limits.
"So, if you write to me, I am so angry because you did that, well, I can't hear your tone of voice to determine how angry."
"Because you got to remember, once you hit that send button, it cannot be retrieve, it cannot be retread."
The damage has been done.
So you want to avoid that.
"Again, it makes it very impersonal."
That's the best part about it.
So I've done this with alligator clips.
"All right, there's our audio jack and this is a live cable."
"This is going into a guitar amplifier over there, so we just kinda put it on there."
"And now, what I've got here are--if you look at the speaker here, there are two terminals."
"Every speaker has two, sometimes three little contacts on it that go to these wires that are going to the circuit board."
"Well, what you can do is you can take your alligator clips and just clip it on those two terminals on the speaker and then you can take the other side of those clips and clip it on to the terminals of your jack here."
"So, if we use the needles, going upward to the lung direction and then we thread needle underneath the skin and if we can go point three, point five inches, we can stimulate two points."
So this is the hand.
"So we are going to do it again with just one dog Ty we would use you, Ursula, Raven come over here now we are going to do it with one dog."
"Hey Ty how are doing? Hey buddy come over here hi what a good boy, yes good job, good boy. So as you can see it is a little bit less chaotic when you are working with one dog at a time and working at the doors we are kind of combining 2 things here and talking about working with multiple dogs and the benefits with working with one dog at a time."
We are going to do this 2 ways I'm going to show you how chaotic it could be if we do it with multiple dogs and then we are going to do it again with just one dog.
"I'm going to go ahead and take what I put on the side before and I am going to place it in here and stir it all up and flavor it up, OK. Let's take that in there now."
So I'm stirring it up and I am going to cook it for a little while longer.
That's absolutely fine.
The marine organism we're going to identify now is the yellowhead jawfish.
"While hovering over their burrow, yellowhead jawfish are constantly feeding."
They're very interesting fish to watch.
Okay we also have our black-beans that we have soaked overnight and they are ready to go into the pot.
The biggest thing that people say when they have a busy schedule is that they just can't get their exercise in.
"Kisco, New York, and it's called La Tulipe Desserts, and I designed their logo."

So let's start with our legs.
"Those are the major, major parts in these types of basic merengue steps."
The leader is traveling and he's taking his dance partner with him.
Any part that's connected.

Hi!
"A written budget will not only help you keep on track, but will also help you to evaluate where your budget needs to be revised."
There are many reasons why a budget might fail or why people give up on their budget but drawing up a budget is usually pure drudgery and livened only by the reality of staring your foolish spending habits in your face.
"Annual costs such as dues, subscription fees and car insurance and divide them out by 12."

Cold water really doesn't give you a lather.
In this clip we're going to be applying the base coat.
"Put a little bit on your paper, and then walk it over to your wall and see if you're close to the grout color, if not, just keep adjusting your paint color."
"We may be a little dark or a little light, you just keep adjusting until you hit that color that you need there."
"And when you think you've got it, you come back and you paint your entire switch plate cover, including the screws."
"You're going to paint your receptacle as well, watching, again, for the little holes there, so you can keep them free of accumulated paint."
In this segment I'm going to talk about Jack completing his backswing.
"And it also wouldn't hurt you, if you start hitting the ball poorly an excellent place to look first is, are you completing your backswing."
"Be like Jack, you're starting to make some mistakes on the course, make sure you're completing your backswing."
Hi!

"If you feel your client getting tense you know to back up just a little bit; ease up just a little bit, perfect."
Then after you do that you can give her a nice little massage with neck and shoulders.
If you have a treble hook that makes it even more difficult.
"This is where you create a nice shape for your lips, like that rosebud lips or if you like those pointed lips, which is up to you."
"And again, fill it in because you don't want to see the lip liner."
You want it to all look natural and blended.
In this clip we are going to talk about record keeping for families who home school.
"Okay we have worked around our third level, side one, corner one, side two, corner two, all the way to these third corners, third side and our very last corner."
"Then again we are going to chain one to keep our float and our pattern and our sizing the same, we are going to go one, two, three, and get our needle in there."
And as much as forty-five thousand dollars a year depending on where you are.
So our next step is going to be conditioning the hair.
"Though if you're only cleaning one record, you don't have to worry about that."
"Once you decide upon the purpose your fence will hold then next thing you want to choose is your style, height, and color."
"So gardening to me is just like meeting everybody else that you meet in your life, you enjoy their company when they're there, and you invite them over whenever you can, but you realized that you can't possibly have every plant in the world in your garden, and it's about change, some plants stay for years and years, some plants go away after two years, but I never take it personally, because I know there's many more plants that I can meet in the future, that will enjoy my garden."
"And so, I like to look on the Internet, onto different websites that give you lots of different ideas on what to plant in your garden, but when it comes down to it, I just collect plants wherever I go, and that's a good rule of thumb."
"You don't always have to know the names of everybody that comes to your party to enjoy their company, so I try to remember the names of the plants that I purchase, but of course I forget some of the names, and in the end, that doesn't really matter, because all that matter is, that you enjoy your garden, because it is an extension of you."
"This Cleopatra canna-lily is of course one of my most favorite plants in my garden, and I've got some in the garden, I've got some in containers, I love the striped leaves."
Let's see and lets try something else I smash my garlic a lot of time before I chop it anyways but I have always been told if you take with the skin on and just hit it that is another way to get the skin off really easy.
There are relief printmaking inks but there is a limited number of pigments available.
"The only difference is in the viscosity of the ink which you can alter for your uses, for what you need."
"So, we'll add our garlic and our capicola or our prosciutto and we're going to want to add some wine, white wine, to deglaze the pan."
So about a half a cup to a cup each.
So we're going to cut that off both parts and then we're going to remove them because that's about the size that we want to chop our garlic.
"So, we'll grab the sides and chop and then we'll do it again."
And what you want to be able to do is you want to be able to level the slate before you put the cloth on.
And you want to have this one room in your life where you can come home at night and rest from all of the exposure.
You don't want to have all those TVâs and DVDs players and phones and it's very important not to have your alarm clock and phone right by your head so that I see quite often.
So if you can Jane here has simple quartz clock that she changed from an electric clock so this is much safer.
"Have you woken up the next day, pounding headache, dry mouth, realized it may have been the amount of drink you had last night?"

"If my armor had already been extended, and I had been in mid-attack and touched, even just after I had stepped off with one foot, the touch would still be in my favor."
"Second of all, that it's better to step off with one foot, than with two feet, if possible, and also that the score will also go in your opponent's favor if you step off the, the piste."
"Now if I'd only stepped over with one foot, a halt would also be called."
And you just keep it clean and take care of that.
"So, see the physician."
Get an anti-viral medication prescription and again that should be good.
"It's a very effective way to get rid of that unwanted hair, but one thing you might want to think about is after the treatment, you might experience some redness, some swelling and some sensitivity."
Make sure your shower is maybe luke warm because it's just going to irritate the skin.
One thing you can do to help that is exfoliate ten days after the treatment.
This beginner Pilates Exercise is called the double leg stretch.
So really concentrate on pulling your abdominal muscles and focus on your breath.
I'm going to put this on here until I get just a gram.
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to measure out a liter of water.
Give it a little bit more heaviness on the bottom of the bag.
You could even sew in a little bit of interfacing in here if you want to make it a nice stiff bottom.
"So, that is it for potatoes, thank you have a good day."
You want to make sure the color is even all the way around.
From here you are going to twist that shoulder and face towards your other side.
Thanks for watching.
You don't want it above or below but straight in line with that shoulder and then you are going to slowly start to turn your body out to the left side.
Or give a line.
"I'm looking at though and I'm thinking to myself, it looks nice, I like the color of it."
Such as maybe something out of here.
With safety glasses and some type of foot and protection and covering.

Torso Twist with Buddha Arms and elbows extended.
As you twist keep the hands in front don't let them go ahead.
Keeping the hips facing forward if you notice my belly button is still facing the same way as I'm twisting.

"I'm Captain Joe Bruni, stay safe and we'll see you next time."
"Also using media, to keep this layer thinner."

"They did make this style of clock, called the Neuchatel clock, it goes back to the seventeen hundreds, but they actually still make reproductions of them today."
"And when you buy the reproductions now is Switzerland, perhaps, they always come with that same bracket, with the same floral paintings and things going on there as well."
My cotton candy cone didn't look like this on my first try.
"So it's really hard at first, you have to get the hang of it."

"The second alternative to dentures would be to put an implant, a root tooth substitute in the bone, put a ball attachment on top of it, put the female portion of the ball attachment into a denture and then have that denture snap into place to where now the denture is supported actually by the bone."
The only other alternative to dentures is nothing.
I would suggest having coffee for more than two weeks after it's opened.
Don't go for the already preground stuff.

"So your power down swing after a power back swing, intent, use everything, and let the ball determine the angle that you're going to swing, natural and hard."
"Another part of it is to make sure that you're using everything that you have, your hands, your arms, your body, your intent, you're using everything."
"Now if you look at the way this is set up, this is one of your newer setups as far as shower goes."
This one on the end is a flow rate valve and this is a water saver so you can crank it up if you really want to get a great burst of water or you can cool it down while you are shaving.
"What we're going to do, is lift your right hip, and place this blanket, right under that right hip, and then go ahead and relax the legs."
And I'm using a stick and a half of unsalted butter.
You don't want it melted.
"It goes from this solid little clumpy thing to what's starting to be a batter, like a cookie batter."
"Ooh there's another good thing, cookie batter. Yum. I'm thinking you'd do this for about a minute, a minute and a half at the most."
You want to use a paddle attachment.
"As you exercise more, your heart, and all the other tissues of your body become more efficient at utilizing the oxygen for creating energy."

"So yeah, workbench that's about the right size, you can have your soldering iron there, you want to be near an electrical outlet where you can put the soldering iron and have enough space to work."
"I might not normally have everything that I use for circuit bending on the table at one time and I've just kind of done that here because we're making these videos, but you do want a space that kind of a nice space you can clear and put your project in front of you, a place where your soldering iron is handy."
"It's going to be broken up and throw into our bigger dish anyway, so it doesn't matter what it looks like."
"I just entered a cup, I couldn't quite figure out."
So the third thing that I did was to unload my kitchen.

So now once I've drawn the outlines on the back of the picture frame I go ahead and cut around the edges being left with a square piece of cardboard that's going to sit right onto the back of the picture and make up the backing of the picture frame."
We see now that the backing that we've cut fits right over the picture frame and we've left enough border so that it doesn't fall through and it also doesn't show over the edges of the picture frame.
"So whatever the size is I add a quarter of an inch around the entire border: first on the left side and the right side, then I measure the top and the bottom."

I could even do another Nick Nicky Silver monologue.
So she plays something romantic.
"It might be good to pick something that involves a monologue that talks about romance, something a little romantic."
"With this process where you have the brush, it's a similar process."
Ask them if they're a warm boot or not because your feet will get cold.

"We just cut, on our jeans, we cut the whole waistline out."
"Notice how he leans back, allows the ball to come to him and makes that pass."
He even passes it with his right and left foot.
"So, this is a trick that I use, there's such a thing called, tailors wax."
The technique we're working on in this series is a higher level threat than the wrist grabs we worked on earlier.
She'll be initiating a defense before I have a chance to get her all the way off of her feet.
"There's fused glass, which means it's made in a kiln, and you actually fuse the glass together and create your own glass, make bowls, plates, platters."
"And today, I get to play with foiled glass."
I teach a variety of classes.
They can say something ragefully.
"So this is probably not very important to say, but there are ways where you can influence--you can influence the way a line is said when it's not very specific."
"And these are some of the ways where you can describe who you're character is and what they are--what they're doing, what--basically give people a general outline on what your character is all about."
"Well, you're going to have people talk about your character but you're also going to have to have some kind of introduction to who your character is."
"Once you've gotten the 'V' on all four, for the beaks, you're ready to go to the next part of your design."
"At the very tip of your head, you're going to do very small 'V' shape."
"Okay, so we've talked a lot about telescopes here and hopefully we're better educated, but how about some choices--some varieties--to help you choose telescopes, and what you might consider when you're ready to buy a telescope."
"This is 130 millimeter, just over five inches, and it is a GoTo telescope."
Why the same price point?
It's a manual operation.
"I think that'd be difficult... maybe I should get a telescope like this."""
Our quarterback will take the snap and this time we're not going to fake to the fullback.
"And then, there are certain types of steels that you can select for those type of applications that will be able to hold a decent edge, but they're usually quite expensive."
"Where a decent high carbon steel you can get for a couple dollars a pound, where a good stainless steel you're going to pay anywhere from fifteen to thirty dollars a pound in selecting the type of steel that you need."
"The steel that I choose to make most of my knives out of is what's called fifty-one sixty, I get it in just a long bar."
"And so what we do is we just take a strap, we call it a cam strap, and we'll run it through the slots of the canoe chair like so."
"Hello, I'm Kyle Brayer, and you're next in-home abdominal work out is the scissor kick."
"So, here she's pointing her toes."
You can do it at home or in the gym.
And that exercise is the scissor kick.
"If you were spraying your hair before you do the braid, I definitely recommend using a light hold hairspray."
"Depending on the coarseness of your hair and the thickness of your hair, you're going to want to intrude something that's a little heavier."
It is a front approach.
"If you can see, I'm tracing a V on the floor."
"Now, we're just going to take it wider, so we have V step."
"The water is actually to clean off the beer pong balls, okay?"
"Those are the supplies that you need, so let's move on to the next step."
"Right, let me tell you the supplies needed in beer pong."
And that's a pull off.
"So, our tab told us 17th fret on the B string, so I'm going to use my third finger."
"So, it's going to look like that."
"I'm going to pick and I'm going to pull off in kind of a down and up at the same time motion with my third finger, kinda down and up."
"Otherwise why would you only stop at one side, what's the point of that?"
"A vest is pretty much literally means that it is going to be the same on both sides so that is why I drew it like this, it is easier to follow."
"When we need to do root canal, we need to go into the chamber of the tooth."
"They're all situated on the inner part of the tooth and so what we have to do for the most part, when you get a cavity, the cavity is on the top surface or from the side, it breaks through the enamel and into part of the tooth structure and then basically exposing these inner part nerve tissue and the blood supply."
"Once that's all done, this area is sealed with a rubber-based material, and in doing so, the bacteria from outside cannot go in and from the top, cannot go back out."
"During the examination, he will examine your breasts by palpation feeling the breast to make sure that there are no abnormalities."
"At first, I'm going to do a Lazy Firefly, which I have to say I really prefer because it's a little lazy."
"In Standing Firefly, we come forward."
And then I'll wait thirty seconds.
"And so what you'll do then is pull the diffuser out of your tea and discard the water, or the tea that's steeping in your cup."
You don't want extra chemicals in your tea.
Now at this point I'd like to use a strainer like this and dip it into the wine.
"Once you got the fruit in there you would gather this up like this, with the fruit in it, and you would start twisting this, and the fruit would start juicing out juicing out all the great juices through the colander and into the pot down here."
And we're going to chop now our green scallion.
So make sure you keep them on the side and don't put them in your bowl.
And want to just score the onion and pull away the outer shell and begin to chop it up.
"Hi, this is Liz Muller from Liz's Hair Design in Hollywood, Florida."
"This is an example of relaxed hair, African American hair."
"And then, of course, the blockage created by the object will create a cast shadow against the wall which we see here."
"If you see here along the edge, there's just a little bit of light from this wall that's being bounced back at the urn."
"For example, this alcove, we see the key elements of light and shadow."
You see these molds have some fairly fine details in them.
A little bit about granulated sugar.
You can get granulated sugar in a lot of different grain sizes and sometimes if you just go get generic granulated sugar it doesn't really say anything about the size of the grains.
"You find the telephone pole, raise it up to the wire, and move across the wire, and there's the bird, hopefully he hasn't flown."
"Where I've got my body perpendicular to a line where the bird is, I look at the bird."
What's coming in older toilets 40 years old and older is lime will buildup in the jet way around the toilet.
"But I'll tell you, for five dollars a quart, it?s much better to save an old toilet and de-lime the rim than it is to throw the toilet away."
It?s an acid solution and what we do we take and we pour this whole quart in to the overflow tube all at once.
You will then notice that the acid is coming out of the rim of the toilet.
Occasionally I will need two quarts and rarely I'll need three.
"And on an ending note if taking care of your tank, make sure you look at your fish tank everyday not only when you're feeding your fish but just to makes sure that you haven't lost any."
"Unfortunately as I was doing a water change on my tank, I noticed one of my gold dust mollies has passed away."
"There, again, don't put the big fish in a commode."
"It's very, very daunting to not know who to go to when your relationship is in trouble."
But make sure that you read the label and instructions that come along with your blanket so that you don't ruin the waterproof barrier of the blanket.

But this drink actually tastes fantastic.
And follow that up with a shot of Malibu Rum.
I'm sticking it to the back.
"And the way we are going to do this is with a pin tool, and I showed you earlier."
"The spine is capable of elongating, it's capable of moving laterally on each side, it's capable of twisting to each side, it's capable of a back bend, and a forward bend, so actually those are really seven movements of the spine."
It's going to be a little dry because it's curly.
A good hydrating shampoo.
Scrub the hair real well and then proceed to condition after.
Nice and thick like this and put the towel over.
We use a hydrating shampoo.
It also gives her a little bit of conditioning.
Hi!
"Secondly, because it is metal, while it's made to use in your microwave, it can still cause problems, so you want to not use it, not leave it in there as much as possible."
We're just going to rinse it off and then put it to the side to dry.
Then just use your mild dish soap that you would use for cleaning your dishes and silverware.
"First of all, this helps prevent it from getting dirty."
Some of the hoods or net covers will have a strap that attaches to a halter so it's got even more strength for moving around.
So this net cover is going to keep him pretty much covered from the elements from his neck and it won't allow any of the moisture to get down inside his blanket and run down into or on his chest or inside the blanket.
This one doesn't necessarily go with this blanket but will just show you how it works. It slides up over the top of their head and then comes down thru their ears and they can see through it there we go so it would fit down over their face.
Now you'd say why do I need a hood for my horse.
It doesn't do much good if you're showing a horse to have him smooth and shiny up to right here and then his chest and head is hairy cause then you're going to need to body clip that and once you body clip it he's going to be cold there and then you're going to need to apply a hood.
That means you didn't iron it long enough.
So if you try to iron it and it's not sticking.
Or maybe the flat seven to make it a seven chord.
And lower the five to make it a flat five or a diminished chord on the bottom with a flat seven on the top.
"Here's the major scale, all seven notes."

"Like any other type of photography that I talk about, really, your first little foot in the door is finding someone who does it professionally and spend a day with them and see what it's like because it might not be anything what you think it's like or it might be even better than you think it is, and you can find out that you're suited for that type of photography."
Holding the triangle the triangle itself which is gonna produce the tone and the hammer that helps you with that.
"Obviously, the main thing to the 6-2 defense is we want to stop the run."
"Into the pass, thumbs down, ok?"
"Create momentum as you pass the ball, ok?"
"Extend, good."
Right.
Championship teams begin with defense and we're going to play pro defense.
"Just hit him right there, he dribbles, comes down, man cuts to the basket, chest pass, right?"
In this clip I'm going to teach you how to draw a jeans and t-shirt outfit for our girl here.
"And since, I would make these jeans not completely form fitting."
I might come down here maybe add some wrinkles along the sides.
Draw her upper body and her neck just like that.
Now we've got lava.
Got baking soda here.
Okay.
"Now this one is great for small children because we just have baking soda and vinegar, there's no hot water, there's no complicated setup."
"And you can keep on adding until you're out of baking soda, that works great with groups of children."
"And there we have it, that's how to make a small volcano."
I'm using a little flask here but you can use a pop bottle.
Anything that's got a narrow mouth on it.
"Now our lava, let's make our lava."
So Firefox is coming down to the computer and it is going to give us all three programs in the download program and we will be in a position to execute those programs in the next segment.
One thing to make sure of in the post route is that you really push that defensive back and get him in the back peddle so they think you're going long.
The quick slant route is to get us a quick pass in the middle to try to go behind the linebackers and pick up about 5 or 6 yards.
I'm standing next to a sewer discharge.
This is actually water rain retention discharge so the survey may in fact show that the sewer company maintains the right to have access to this small area.
Today we're here to talk about low maintenance gardening.
Another advantage of a small garden is there's not that many weeds.
"So don't let them get out of hand, it's not that much of a hassle."
Now another thing that you can do with your wax is use it as a decorative effect.
It can be anything.
"And what this is going to do is when you go to dip this pot in the glaze, which I'll demonstrate in a moment, this glaze will resist, I mean this wax will resist the glaze."
"So you'll have your glaze, a little bit of a halo seeping into the wax area, and then these nice decorative areas that you've left blank."
You need to have enough so that you'll get decent sound.
"as part of safety go, we went through the ""S"", ""A"" is for atmosphere."

"We're taking our bacon, the pieces that we cut and now we're rendering that in a heavy pot here and we want to render a lot of the bacon fat off."
"And we want this bacon to crisp up a little bit so we render, we're doing this on a medium high heat and you know you just move it around, you don't want it to burn it can let is sit for a little bit."
"If you didn't want to use bacon, you can use ham, you can use Canadian bacon but like I said I like to use the hickory smoke just for that smoky flavor."
These will be other ways of trying to identify whether your fish is sick.
"That way, you will be able to distinguish when there are differences."
"Once you bring your car in, you should be able to have the mechanic look over your car and assess any repairs that need to be made."
So you want to look for a mechanic that specializes in your particular make.
"Since they probably have more experience with that model of car, they'll probably do a better job."
So another thing you can do when deciding which mechanic you should go to is you can go to the Better Business Bureaus' website and you can look up the name of the company and see if there's any complaints or how the customers' have rated that particular mechanic.
"I'm Laura Gibson, beauty expert here to tell you the different between curling irons."
"Chrome, gold and ceramic."

That's a behind the back brush.
Now obviously there's not a lot of room there when you're doing a behind the back brush but if you time it just right and get your body out of the way you should be able to do it.
"So, what we want to do is make this mark and this mark meet."
"But if you're not quite for sure, just grab a pin, and just stick it in, right where that one mark is and bring it out and look it goes right through to the other mark."
Remember to move around.
"As it's spinning, really notice the hoop pressing into your stomach and your back as Hannah explained."
It has a magnet and it holds it then you can use it to work on your things with that.
Hello.
Why does it have that?
Most folks will use the little plastic stopper and then you take one of your champagne wires and you put it over the top of it.
The halo of glass allows the bottom of the champagne wire to hold on underneath there so that when fermentation develops that cork won't pop right out of the champagne bottle.
"If you choose to drink it, which I don't recommend, there should be no caffeine at all."
"One other thing about flowering tea, is the flowers inside the tea has added health benefits."
Now when you use a hammer it's always important to wear your safety gear.

"Don't grip the hammer too hard, kind of loosely and use a good deal of momentum."

Now in this segment I am going to go over umbilical cord care.
"Or just go in if you know you're not using folders or even programs, go in and delete those and that'll clear that off of there."
"So maybe buying an external hard drive to keep your music and movies and whatever, your personal files on that."

So as I grab I have to shift my body position alright and I strike lower spot.
Novalash offers a mascara formulated especially for lash extensions.
"However, if used everyday, certain ingredients in that mascara may help break down the adhesive bond."
"The lashes are not only black, but also thick in diameter creating thick black lashes about the use of mascara."
"Where we see a lot of cars and do a lot of waxes on a day to day basis, we've been very happy with this wax protectant we're about to use, and then the question is how you're going to apply it to the car."
"Small little swirls is ok. You want to go back and forth. Not, we're not doing it like they did in the ""wax on wax off""."
Of course the cars has got to be clean.
Now we actually use an orbital buffer.
Baking is really a science it makes a big difference if you have a teaspoon extra of flour or any other ingredient or to lessen one ingredient or too little of one ingredient.

Hi!
"In next segment, we're going to discuss setting the water level on your washing machine itself."

"Now, as the ball moves, his assignments are going to change."
"Now, when someone does develop type two diabetes they generally notice they're feeling very tired, less energy, sleepy a lot."

"My block of wood next to my print gives you a really clear idea of that mirror image, and in this print in particular, since there is text, although it is in Italian, you can see how carving it in the mirror image is going to be very important for its final."
These are elements that you can use to help enhance your print.
"And, as you can see they're kind of spread out here so they're using the plants."
"These are the kind of things that you should talk to your pet shop, tropical fish expert about, he'll know these things."
"So, in other words, in a, in a, in a tank that's a ten gallon tank like this, about ten inches of fish."
"Now obviously if you get a ten inch fish, yeah he could live in here but, you get to a ten inch fish Oscar, something like that, you're going to want to go with a bigger tank, cause that's not going to be really fair to the fish to go with a ten inch fish in this, this, this small of a tank, wouldn't be fair to, to, the fish and you wouldn't enjoy it either."
"So, so that's what we're looking at here as far as fish."

An unsuccessful nil bid is worth negative one hundred points.
The difference in this game is you have to bid either nil or at least four tricks.

"All of the sudden that word becomes a distracting barrier to communication, because you're thinking about the fact, well, wait a minute, I'm not a man."
Now an umbrella is exactly like it sounds.
Now I don't want to use a raw strobe on someone because it might be a little bit too harsh so that is when I'll use my umbrella and I can position my umbrella in a certain way that I can actually control my lighting a bit more than if I am just using a raw strobe or a diffuser so that is how that I like to use umbrellas.
"When the dog finds that person, you've already set that person up with maybe some treats, or maybe a ball if the dog really enjoys the ball, or some other reward that's very motivating for that dog."

"The crazier and the more off the wall you can get with your noises, the more fun and the more challenging it's going to be for the actor that is on stage."
I'm going to start off with a blank slate.
"A couple of websites one of them is americanwhitewater.org that has a national river data base you can get river list things and you can also get, some of them have online gage sources so you can tell if a river is running high or low and if its appropriate for you to run."
"Iâm grabbing it at the waist, and Iâm, if youâll look, youâll see this is the front skirt area and on this side, is the bodice and a sleeve and Iâm just going to fold it at the waist, back towards the back side."

What have we added?
You can see the patch doesn't go all the way to the edge of the sail because we're going to need to fold this edge over; as well as fold the foot edge over.
"Again, I'm trimming the clew patch here to make sure the grommet falls in the thickest part where all the layers meet."

"Racket back, you're hand and arm go out to the right and you're turning it over."
And that's one indication to know that you actually combined the image properly.

Dogs tend to like to use the same spot where they've gone before.
You can also bring in some of their feces from outside and put it in the litter box again to draw them to that and then just work slowly.
You might need to confine your dog until you think that they need to go to the bathroom and then only give them access to that litter box so that hopefully that's where they'll choose to go.
Anybody can wear this no matter how big they are.
So the warranty is set by the manufacturer.
It's going to last a lot longer than going back and buying something in two years because you didn't have an extended warranty.
"The manufacturer sets up the warranty, through the normal wear and tear, or the normal defects."
So that's a really good way to work with paper and make sure people feel that they're getting a good quality product which they are.
You will start with a pair of round nose pliers.

You want to make thin slices as thin as possible.
You don't want to over fill your enchiladas.
"In tennis the ball has to go first over the net, which is your first challenge and second the ball has to land in the court."
"Single lines is when youâre playing one person against another person, the ball has to go inside this area and then inside the base line all the way to the second single court, single line."
Outside would be everything else.
So we will start with this nice piece of blank paper.

"It has the top button on the, on the, on the top piece and then starts down here."
"Let's talk about how to stick your opponent with taking the queen of spades, or risking taking the queen of spades."

Those may be some signs of senile dementia you may notice.
This cord is plugged into part of my camera and actually lets me be able to hold this flash or put it onto a light stand to incorporate this in my photography.

"And the others, they might see you as a plumber, so let's just say that."

"This is a period of graduate medical education, during which you learn your specialty."
"As you, when you're in completion of your undergraduate experience you'll need to take what is called the Medical College Admissions Test."
We are talking about how to throw Ninja Stars.
You don't want to let your arm pass too far because then your release will be off and you will throw the Ninja Star off so you want to make sure that your arm is locked out to wherever you are throwing your Ninja Star at.
That is just a little bit more information about Ninja Stars and how to get started in throwing.
Part of the fun of Pokemon is that it is a collectible card game.
Your killer deck.
"We can use--we can make a clasp just like this that doesn't--that even though this one won't go in, I'm going to make one like this that will fit in this hole and work just fine."
And I'm going to actually make the hole big enough that I can cut down farther in with my grinding bit.
"So, I'm just going to go in until the hole appears to be wide enough that I can cut down a little further with this one."
"Originally, I was going to use this bit to go all the way through but that hole is looking really, really good."
This is where a strong logo icon and bold logo type will really stand out.
"However, there are many occasions when the use of a multi-colored logo just will not be practical."

"It's the color that goes with the rest of the house, and you can just break the mold and do whatever makes you kind of energetic -- a bright apple green, an orange."
"Here, we are going to do an open break, so we'll push on one, pull on two, now here's what we want to do we want to pull the girl forward and make her turn at the same time."
"We're going to push her forward on five, turn her on six, catch her on seven."
What you want to avoid doing is bringing the left hand over here to the right hand because that makes the girl feel like she's supposed to turn.
So we're going to be replacing that with a better insulated door.
"Now additionally, there is a significant amount of air that leaks through the door on the bottoms, on the sides and on the top."
We're going to doing the jump.

We are going to use a base coat of wax and then a top coat of wax in order to create grip so we don't slip: that would be a rookie mistake.

Another natural remedy is to make a paste of sandalwood powder and rosewater.
"You also want to make sure that along with all your decorative scissors, you have just a regular pair of scissors for any other cutting you might want to do."

"So mainly the first steps or stages of a facial of any facial really, you want to prepare the skin and cleansing and exfoliating helps to open the skin's pores so that the skin can receive the other products or ingredients of the rest of the treatment so when the skin's pores are wide open you're going to benefit the most from the treatment."
"It's a; you want to make sure you have the proper alignment on your vehicle whenever you do, get new tires so that they're not wearing unevenly because sometimes if the alignment is off very badly you will get a wavy fashion across the tread and this is another problem; this could cause a vibration as you're driving down the street from this being chopped up in this fashion and that's usually what they call tire chop."
And that concludes dealing with tire tread on the automotive vehicle.
"Now, I didn't plan it that way or buy these two together but sometimes you kind of luck out and while you're piecing things together in your closet, you have two things that just kind of seem like they fit together."

So grab it and push it up towards the scalp.
And that's how you scrunch your hair.
So when you get out of the shower you just want to take your towel and kind of go in and just remove as much water as possible.
You can even use a spray gel.
And there's our finished clown mask.
You want to do just a big arch over both of the eyes like that with nice bright colors.
"So, when you're speaking with your tailor or maybe the rental place, where you're going to be renting your suit, or someone that is designing and creating something special for you, one thing to consider is different neck shapes that you have, which are going to kind of alter the shoulder style that your garment is going to be tailored in; your jacket specifically."
"So, there's different ways to measure that, or there's different ways to kind of point out or notice and take into account, meaning what type of shoulder you want based on your neck, whatever neck you've been given."
"Keeping this in mind, he knows that the tiger was also a larger animal than most of the other animals and the tiger's techniques would not be something that a smaller person would be able to use."
"The tiger's techniques were head on, they were for someone who is stronger, and fast and the techniques often show that, for example we do a technique called tiger on guard, tiger crouches, tiger strikes to the throat."
This is not a technique you would do to someone who is much bigger than you.
People might just run into the plant.
So in order to make our plant more secure.
"Especially, when we use a plastic container like this, too."
"Decorative rocks, large boulders."
Or we can also use little ornaments like this.
"Hopefully, you shouldn't have too many problems with your plant being unstable."
Or another really great technique is to simply prop the plant up.
So that it's leaning against the wall.
Large and small.
"But sometimes, if a plant has a shallow root system."
So think of the value you will be receiving just from this one customer alone.
"If you retain customer's, then you not only retain your business for a month, a year, but it could go on longer than that."
Think about the customer base that you could build upon from that one customer.
Then the secret ingredient to this is going to be cilantro.
"A cilantro is a interesting vegetable you got to really wash it well or you're going to find sand and grit in it, so wash it and stem it."
Good.
Very nice.
"Forward, back; forward, back."
The other function of a plum line is to tell you where your posts are going to go.
"We call it a foot because it sits on there, right?"
"We're going to start right in the center smear it around like this, if you get to much on there as you tip it, which we don't want to do, as we tip it wax rolls off runs down the side glaze won't stick to there."
"Since it didn't do that we still have some wax in our sponge so I'm going to go about a quarter of an inch at least slowly turn the pot turning my wrist, both wrists like that all the way over."
That's how to run the out route.
The out route can be very effective.
Let's try combining the 2.
"You can really have some fun with putting the hoop down by extending that second arm through the hoop, turning slowly and then giving the hoop a whirl."
"Lift ups and drop downs are a lot of fun, so play with them and make this trick your own."
"If you ever see them in action they really do, they just slide right in the dirt like it's water and disappear right away."
They don't get very big.
There are a couple of different species of sand boas.
"Sand boas are one of the few snakes where you can actually tell the sex by dimorphism which means they have, both sexes have different characteristics."
The males have a longer tail section.
"Interesting things about the sand boas, the sand boas do live most of their lives underground."
Just to make sure that everybody is up to snuff on the situation.
"Two identical dice, right and the object is to roll them both at the same time."
"There's six plus four equals ten so the whole deal is you're playing with two six sided dice and probability is at play and the thing, the combination, the sum that most often comes up will be seven because it's most likely with two six sided dice to get a seven than anything else."
"Now, the abscess is only painful if you bite hard on it or if your; if you become infirmed enough that your normal immune system doesn't attack it."
"So, surgery is avoided; surgery is done at the apex of the tooth for one of several reasons."
The early portion of an abscess tooth is quite uncomfortable there is a lot of pain from the intense pressure.
What you are going to want to do when you start waxing is you are going to want to take your iron and hold it above the snowboard and touch it with your bar of wax and your wax will begin to drip off.
Now weâre going to lower the car.
And the second he comes to you you're going to praise him heavily and make him feel very good about what he's done.
The topic of today's discussion is teaching your dog how to come when called.
"They are typically very inexpensive, in the 10 to 20 dollar range but by comparison a good felt hat for those of you who don't know is going to run you anywhere from 100 to 300 dollars so if you want a hat like this a good hat box is a tremendous investment."
And we would do a couple of these to show you this style and then we get them into the deep fryer in a minute and see what happens from there.
That's called interference.
One thing that's important is when you're trying to make an interception; you have to have a good read on the ball.
Quick ball reversal will really hurt this defense.
This defense is designed to stop the outside shot.
So the weak spots are here and here.
"Now, you have to have athletes in order to really run this defense."
"It's really, really important."
"Or, they're going to be used to balancing with their neck a great deal, which is going to cause issues along the back area and in the hindquarters."
These are real nice because you don't have to do any folding of the ground cloth or anything like that.
The next thing I want to talk to you about is silence.
"No, I'd rather be silent and punish you, than tell you how I'm really feeling or thinking."
And what does that communicate?
You can use one or two.
And then all those other I's have different meanings too.
"OK, so there are many different ways in which we can write that letter I, and it indicates how we feel about ourselves."
Once you rolled out your pie crust take a spatula and just kind of work it under it cause you don't want to tear it.
If it's stuck anywhere from underneath non commercial surface and it would be hard to get off.
So obviously I can't go all the way to the middle but to move it to our pie pan.
We're just going to flop it this over anyway like a burrito.
"And the dealer has his 3 cards and your going to place your bet because a pair kings is a very good hand to have and you see the dealer also has a pair of kings so your thinking now what are we going to do, cause everybody has a pair of kings, were going to the 3rd card since you have a queen, and the dealer has a 5, you are the winner, so your going to win your ante, your going to win your bet, and your also going to win your pair plus because you do have a pair of kings."
And you're trying to get away from it.
"Make sure you don't look at the floor, this whole time."
Or moving back.
One and two.
"Well, you've got to learn how to slip."
So you have balance.
"The most common mistake people make, slipping, is they look at the floor as they go down."
Sometimes the person who is first out is not the one who wins.
Wild cards are allowed to play any time.
So the goal of Uno is to be the first to have all your cards out of your hand and to have the most points afterwards.
"Now, don't think that just because you're not between those two white lines that you're not an important part of the offense, because even the smartest base runners, needs help getting around the bases."
"Again, dealing up, up, up, dealer card up, up, up, up and in this case, the next card I put is down or called the hole card, and again, slide into the table so nobody can see and put it under."
"The next card is up, what I do is put it toward the right of the card, why?"
Pull out on your lever.
Something that goes from newborn on through.
Well I made an angry face because I'm really mad that I missed the bus this morning or whatever it is.
"You have everybody sit in a circle, they're all sitting down and one person is going to make a face."
"Now as you continue with any business, you are going to learn a lot more about that."
Any time you can educate your customer and we will speak about this a little bit more in detail later.
Then you are helping that customer better communicate with you what their expectations may be in the future.
This is your first mix we have a second mix coming up.
I prefer to always have people speak in the present tense.
"So, you want to go ahead and make sure they're in there solid."
This would be your heel strap and toe strap.
"Pandering is not the answer, but how do you compliment a man who catches your eye?"
Maybe he has something on his shirt.
He's there.
You don't need to use an odometer and keep track of every mile that you ride.
It's got three legs and folds down.
"A lot of tripods, the more professional kinds have levels on them."
You don't want to put your camera into a tripod too tight.
"It is a very sturdy, trusty tripod."
"So we have our yummy bacon, I'm taking it to our cast iron grill which is kind of smoking right now, which is the way I want it."
I'm going to turn it off.
"Hopefully, your screen catcher is still working and right now it's giving us basic systems for Tim."
We're going to go back into Tim and what we need to do if we want to get rid of Tim's account is we need to log him out.
So we're going to go on to our system preferences.
Bye.
"If the paint is already dry, what you'll have to do is wet the area, like this."
You see where I've blotted; it's removed paint.
"In a lot of cases, you can't remove the paint entirely; it's just impossible, but you can get some of it out."
Inside a tanning salon we have these acrylics that you lay on and it will damage the acrylics and so we don't allow anything into a tanning salon that's not been approved for indoor tanning.
So it has to say approved for indoor tanning before we let any of our clients use any other kind of product.
"And you're going, each step, the opposite arm is coming with you, just like...just like you're running."

Barney's always has a good selection of hot chocolate and flavors.
"Then we found of course, Cadbury's."

What we've done is we've put together things that have to do with chocolate or that will compliment chocolate.
"Our position for the next break which will be a fist, one board fist, is walking stance, which is about shoulder with a distance from the board."
Okay?
"So now what I'm going to do is place it right on the braid, go under the braid, and through the top of the hair extension here."
You've got to first put a braid at the back of your hair.
Now you're going to use a needle and thread like I have here.
"I like using these glass, kind of these melted glass marbles and you can get these in all kinds of craft stores."
"See the legs and all of that come out, donât be squeamish about this, this is real easy and your reward is wonderful."

"Sometimes, with these sizes of shrimp you wonât really find a mud vein too much in the, the back of them."
"Donât worry if you, if you get the bigger shrimp, sometimes they do."
Some have never heard her sing so that was a great idea.
We're going to cover a little bit about the actual proper footwear to wear for jump roping.
"Now, I am going to show you how to give a prep beat for the ensemble to come in on beat four."
Of course!
"It's a little fragile sometimes, like anything else you have to be careful."
"What they, the thing that makes them breaking pliers is if you look at tip, see how the tip comes together at an angle?"
"Furthermore, this particular set of pliers I like has kind of this sort of rubber kind of shoe, this kind of protective rubber, kind of on top of the metal which allows you to get a firm grip but it still provides a little bit of kind of protection of digging into that glass or maybe cracking that glass even more."
"So you don't need to have those, that sort of rubber housing on the tips but I like it."
I think a couple of things are happening in here.
A 6 o'clock date on a weekday.
I'm going to try to show you how you can wear something to work and transition that same outfit into an appropriate date for after work.
"If you have, actually, hair that's course, curly, you might want to choose, here's one, Semi De Lino Shampoo."
"Once again, in this clip, we are going to be hooping in the opposite direction, a very challenging thing to do."
Kind of back and forth.
"Once again, if it starts to fall, really give it that kick."
"The faster you turn, the more the hoop will float."
"Hi, I'm Kerri and I'm at Zebra in Berkeley."
It is vital at this point to have the wire leader.
"What I asked them to do by just picking up the glass and putting their nose in it, and smelling, was just to get the initial impression of the smell of a wine, or the wine's primary or first aroma, and a wine's primary or first aroma will be; smells like wine."
"Because of that we turn off and on the oven, I mean the mixer."
"It depends on what kind of coverage you want, what your skin's like, what kind of feel, or what kind of texture you like on your face."
"These usually will work well for people who first of all, want a quick application."
It's a radial tire.
There is a number of good patterns ideas that you can get from your local fabric store.
But this one was a good one that gave me some ideas for the one that I would be doing today.
"I would be using some coordinated fabric, different patterns but similar color schemes an other options that you might want to consider are gingham, floral, many different colors that work well together."
Curly hair or wavy hair has more of a disulfide bond which is the way that the proteins are actually bonded together.
"Whether it's your first time ice fishing or your fiftieth time ice fishing, it's always good to fish with someone."

This is a much more recent forest from the Lorwyn expansion set.
"As the sets have progressed, the way the cards are templated has become much more refined."
"The other thing I want to stress is: don't think you need to spend ten or fifteen minutes at a time on one bag, just hitting that same bag over and over again."
"But what I like to see is have the boxer do three rounds with a normal speed and power and then go do something else, speed bag or something, and then come back to the heavy bag again."

Another thing to keep in mind is position of your body on the board.
You really have to wait to feel the wave pick you up.
And as you go down you get more speed.
"Once you feel the board moving faster than you're paddling it, that's when you know you've caught the wave."
"Well, their motion is perpendicular to the beach, but the waves themselves come in, and here's the beach, the waves are coming in like this and they're breaking each way."

"We just want to have some nice big image, and also you can notice how it takes up the full size of the paper, from left to right, and this is basically how you want to make your image."

"Well that's nice, a little family story there."
"And you can catch it on the fly, which means just catch it in the air, one, two, shot."
"Or you can catch it and dribble, and when you dribble, once you pick up your dribble -- see because I'm moving my foot -- that's one step, two steps, shot."

Now we can lower the vehicle slightly so that the weight of the vehicle would be held by the jack stands and also by the jack.
You don't want to over-gesture or under-gesture.
"You have to work in the moment on your organizational skills, and good public speakers are very organized, but you don't have any notes to follow so you have to logically think as you go about how I want to present this."

"I don't have any notes, I don't have any guidelines, I don't have any outline, I don't have anything, so I have to respond to feedback in the moment."
"You ask me the question, I think about it, I respond."

"But the letters should be measured, and you should give yourself guidelines where I've made a stack of eight pen widths, and that's going to be the height of my letters."
So we're going to be starting there.
And if I was to start I'm going to make eye contact with someone in the circle and I'm going to clap at them.

"Now when you're zooming you always want to make it smooth if it's on air, if it's not go right ahead and zoom in fast, zoom out fast, which ever you want to do."
"And then with your focus what you want to do to get proper focus on a subject, is you want to zoom in all the way to that subject, and with your focus you want to either take your focus inward or outward."

"Again, tap, work up toward the hair line."
I call this my Don King brush.
